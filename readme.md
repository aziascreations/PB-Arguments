# PB-Arguments

A simple and powerful launch argument parser.

This project is a reboot of my old "*[PB-Cli-Params-Parser](https://github.com/aziascreations/PB-Cli-Params-Parser)*"
project developed in conjecture with "*[PB-GameFramework](https://github.com/aziascreations/PB-GameFramework)*".

## Documentation

The documentation is not ready yet.

However, there is a short example in the "*[Examples/](Examples)*" directory.
